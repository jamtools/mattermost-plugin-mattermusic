# Mattermusic

Collaborate with your friends on music projects, or just chat about uploaded audio and video files, or linked YouTube videos! Currently the main feature available is to be able to mention timestamps in comments such as `1:20`, and clicking it will seek to that time on whatever media the comment is on.

Future plans are to help maintain a music project with different revisions of files.
